            <h2><b>GPT</b></h2>
            <p>
              With broad general knowledge and domain expertise, GPT-4 can follow complex instructions in natural language and solve difficult problems with accuracy.
            </p>
            <h2><b>OpenAI's original GPT model ("GPT-1")</b></h2>
            <p>
                The original paper on generative pre-training of a transformer-based language model was written by Alec Radford and his colleagues, and published in preprint on OpenAI's website on June 11, 2018. It showed how a generative model of language is able to acquire world knowledge and process long-range dependencies by pre-training on a diverse corpus with long stretches of contiguous text.
                </p>

                <h2><b>GPT-2</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 ("GPT-2") is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to OpenAI's original GPT model ("GPT-1"). GPT-2 was announced in February 2019, with only limited demonstrative versions initially released to the public. The full version of GPT-2 was not immediately released due to concern about potential misuse, including applications for writing fake news. Some experts expressed skepticism that GPT-2 posed a significant threat.

In response to GPT-2, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence responded with a tool to detect "neural fake news". Other researchers, such as Jeremy Howard, warned of "the technology to totally fill Twitter, email, and the web up with reasonable-sounding, context-appropriate prose, which would drown out all other speech and be impossible to filter". In November 2019, OpenAI released the complete version of the GPT-2 language model. Several websites host interactive demonstrations of different instances of GPT-2 and other transformer models.

GPT-2's authors argue unsupervised language models to be general-purpose learners, illustrated by GPT-2 achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and perplexity on 7 of 8 zero-shot tasks (i.e. the model was not further trained on any task-specific input-output examples).

The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 gigabytes of text from URLs shared in Reddit submissions with at least 3 upvotes. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using byte pair encoding. This permits representing any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens
                    </p>

                    <h2><b>GPT-3</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        First described in May 2020, Generative Pre-trained[a] Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an unsupervised transformer language model and the successor to GPT-2. OpenAI stated that full version of GPT-3 contains 175 billion parameters, two orders of magnitude larger than the 1.5 billion parameters in the full version of GPT-2 (although GPT-3 models with as few as 125 million parameters were also trained).

OpenAI stated that GPT-3 succeeds at certain "meta-learning" tasks. It can generalize the purpose of a single input-output pair. The GPT-3 release paper gives an example of translation and cross-linguistic transfer learning between English and Romanian, and between English and German.

GPT-3 dramatically improved benchmark results over GPT-2. OpenAI cautioned that such scaling up of language models could be approaching or encountering the fundamental capability limitations of predictive language models. Pre-training GPT-3 required several thousand petaflop/s-days of compute, compared to tens of petaflop/s-days for the full GPT-2 model.Like its predecessor, the GPT-3 trained model was not immediately released to the public on the grounds of possible abuse, although OpenAI planned to allow access through a paid cloud API after a two-month free private beta that began in June 2020.

On September 23, 2020, GPT-3 was licensed exclusively to Microsoft.
<h3><b>Codex</b></h3>
Announced in mid-2021, Codex is a descendant of GPT-3 that has additionally been trained on code from 54 million GitHub repositories, and is the AI powering the code autocompletion tool GitHub Copilot. In August 2021, an API was released in private beta. According to OpenAI, the model can create working code in over a dozen programming languages, most effectively in Python.

Several issues with glitches, design flaws, and security vulnerabilities have been brought up.

GitHub Copilot has been accused of emitting copyrighted code, with no author attribution or license.

OpenAI announced that they are going to discontinue support for Codex API starting from March 23, 2023.
<h4><b>Whisper</b></h4>
Released in 2022, Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.
                        </p>

                        <h2><b>GPT-4</b></h2>
                        <p>
                            On March 14, 2023, OpenAI announced the release of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), capable of accepting text or image inputs. OpenAI announced the updated technology passed a simulated law school bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers; by contrast, the prior version, GPT-3.5, scored around the bottom 10%. GPT-4 can also read, analyze or generate up to 25,000 words of text, and write code in all major programming languages.

Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions.GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT. OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.
<h3><b>Sora</b></h3>     
Sora is a text-to-video model that can generate videos based on short descriptive prompts[187] as well as extend existing videos forwards or backwards in time.[188] It can generate videos with resolution up to 1920x1080 or 1080x1920. The maximal length of generated videos is unknown.

The team that developed Sora named it after the Japanese word for sky to signify its "limitless creative potential". The technology behind Sora is an adaptation of the technology behind the DALLÂ·E 3 text-to-image model. OpenAI trained the system using publicly-available videos as well as copyrighted videos licensed for the purpose, but did not reveal the number or the exact source of the videos.

OpenAI demonstrated a few Sora-created high-definition videos to the general public on February 15, 2024, stating that the technology was able to generate videos up to one minute long. It also shared a technical report highlighting the methods used to train the model and the model's capabilities. It acknowledged some shortcomings of the system, including struggles in simulating complex physics. Will Douglas Heaven of the MIT Technology Review called the demonstration videos "impressive", but noted that they must have been cherry-picked and may not be representative of Sora's typical output.                              
</p>

                            <h2><b>User interfaces</b></h2>
                            <p>
                                <h2><b>MuseNet and Jukebox (music)</b></h2>
                                Released in 2019, MuseNet is a deep neural net trained to predict subsequent musical notes in MIDI music files. It can generate songs with 10 instruments in 15 styles. According to The Verge, a song generated by MuseNet tends to start reasonably but then fall into chaos the longer it plays.In pop culture, initial applications of this tool were used as early as 2020 for the internet psychological thriller Ben Drowned to create music for the titular character.

Released in 2020, Jukebox is an open-sourced algorithm to generate music with vocals. After training on 1.2 million samples, the system accepts a genre, artist, and a snippet of lyrics and outputs song samples. OpenAI stated the songs "show local musical coherence [and] follow traditional chord patterns" but acknowledged that the songs lack "familiar larger musical structures such as choruses that repeat" and that "there is a significant gap" between Jukebox and human-generated music. The Verge stated "It's technologically impressive, even if the results sound like mushy versions of songs that might feel familiar", while Business Insider stated "surprisingly, some of the resulting songs are catchy and sound legitimate".
<h3><b>Microscope</b></h3>         
Released in 2020, Microscopeis a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of eight neural network models which are often studied in interpretability.Microscope was created to analyze the features that form inside these neural networks easily. The models included are AlexNet, VGG 19, different versions of Inception, and different versions of CLIP Resnet.                              
<h4><b>DALL-E and CLIP (images)</b></h4>
Revealed in 2021, DALL-E is a Transformer model that creates images from textual descriptions.

Also revealed in 2021, CLIP classifies images using textual descriptions. DALL-E uses a 12-billion-parameter version of GPT-3 to interpret natural language inputs (such as "a green leather purse shaped like a pentagon" or "an isometric view of a sad capybara") and generate corresponding images. It can create images of realistic objects ("a stained-glass window with an image of a blue strawberry") as well as objects that do not exist in reality ("a cube with the texture of a porcupine"). As of March 2021, no API or code is available.
<h5><b>DALL-E 2</b></h5>
In April 2022, OpenAI announced DALL-E 2, an updated version of the model with more realistic results. In December 2022, OpenAI published on GitHub software for Point-E, a new rudimentary system for converting a text description into a 3-dimensional model.
<h6><b>DALL-E 3</b></h6>
In September 2023, OpenAI announced DALL-E 3, a more powerful model better able to generate images from complex descriptions without manual prompt engineering and render complex details like hands and text.[205] It was released to the public as a ChatGPT Plus feature in October.
</p>
<h2><b>ChatGPT</b></h2>
<p>
Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence tool built on top of GPT-3 that provides a conversational interface that allows users to ask questions in natural language. The system then responds with an answer within seconds. ChatGPT reached 1 million users 5 days after its launch.

As of 2023, ChatGPT Plus is a GPT-4 backed version of ChatGPT available for a US$20 per month subscription fee (the original version is backed by GPT-3.5).OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist; after being accepted, an additional fee of US$0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model ("prompt"), and US$0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates ("completion"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.

In May 2023, OpenAI launched a user interface for ChatGPT for the App Store on iOS and later in July 2023 for the Play Store on Android. The app supports chat history syncing and voice input (using Whisper, OpenAI's speech recognition model). In September 2023, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT "can now see, hear, and speak". ChatGPT Plus users can upload images, while mobile app users can talk to the chatbot.

In October 2023, OpenAI's latest image generation model, DALL-E 3, was integrated into ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise. The integration uses ChatGPT to write prompts for DALL-E guided by conversation with users.

OpenAI's GPT Store, initially slated for a 2023 launch, is now deferred to an undisclosed date in early 2024, attributed likely to the leadership changes in November following the initial announcement.
