            Cookies: We use cookies to operate and administer our Services, and improve your experience. A “cookie” is a piece of information sent to your browser by a website you visit. You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it.

            <h3><b>2. How we use personal information</b></h3>
            <p>We may use Personal Information for the following purposes:

                To provide, administer, maintain and/or analyze the Services;
                To improve our Services and conduct research;
                To communicate with you; including to send you information about our Services and events;
                To develop new programs and services;

                Aggregated or De-Identified Information. We may aggregate or de-identify Personal Information so that it may no longer be used to identify you and use such information to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, to improve and add features to our Services, to conduct research and for other similar purposes. In addition, from time to time, we may analyze the general behavior and characteristics of users of our Services and share aggregated information like general user statistics with third parties, publish such aggregated information or make such aggregated information generally available. We may collect aggregated information through the Services, through cookies, and through other means described in this Privacy Policy. We will maintain and use de-identified information in anonymous or de-identified form and we will not attempt to reidentify the information, unless required by law.
                
                As noted above, we may use Content you provide us to improve our Services, for example to train the models that power ChatGPT. Read our instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your Content to train our models.</p>
                <h4><b>3. Disclosure of personal information</b></h4>
                <p>In certain circumstances we may provide your Personal Information to third parties without further notice to you, unless required by the law:

                    Vendors and Service Providers: To assist us in meeting business operations needs and to perform certain services and functions, we may provide Personal Information to vendors and service providers, including providers of hosting services, customer service vendors, cloud services, email communication software, web analytics services, and other information technology providers, among others. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process, or store Personal Information only in the course of performing their duties to us.
                    Business Transfers: If we are involved in strategic transactions, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, or transition of service to another provider (collectively, a “Transaction”), your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the Transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction along with other assets.
                    Legal Requirements: We may share your Personal Information, including information about your interaction with our Services, with government authorities, industry peers, or other third parties (i) if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a violation of our terms, policies, or the law; (iv) to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity; (v) to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our products, employees, or users, or the public, or (vi) to protect against legal liability.
                    Affiliates: We may disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with OpenAI. Our affiliates may use the Personal Information we share in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
                    Business Account Administrators: When you join a ChatGPT Enterprise or business account, the administrators of that account may access and control your OpenAI account. In addition, if you create an account using an email address belonging to your employer or another organization, we may share the fact that you have an OpenAI account and certain account information, such as your email address, with your employer or organization to, for example, enable you to be added to their business account.
                    Other Users and Third Parties You Share Information With: Certain features allow you to display or share information with other users or third parties. For example, you may share ChatGPT conversations with other users via shared links or send information to third-party applications via custom actions for GPTs. Be sure you trust any user or third party with whom you share information.</p>
                    <h5><b>4. Your rights</b></h5>
                    <p>Depending on location, individuals may have certain statutory rights in relation to their Personal Information. For example, you may have the right to:

                        Access your Personal Information and information relating to how it is processed.
                        Delete your Personal Information from our records.
                        Rectify or update your Personal Information.
                        Transfer your Personal Information to a third party (right to data portability).
                        Restrict how we process your Personal Information.
                        Withdraw your consent—where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time. 
                        Object to how we process your Personal Information.
                        Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
                        You can exercise some of these rights through your OpenAI account. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your account, please submit your request through privacy.openai.com or to dsar@openai.com.
                        
                        A note about accuracy: Services like ChatGPT generate responses by reading a user’s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like us to correct the inaccuracy, you may submit a correction request through privacy.openai.com or to dsar@openai.com. Given the technical complexity of how our models work, we may not be able to correct the inaccuracy in every instance. In that case, you may request that we remove your Personal Information from ChatGPT’s output by filling out this form.
                        
                        For information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see this help center article.
